# Forecasting Mental Wellbeing: A Suicide Predictor and Mental Health Problems

We have developed a predictive model using random forest regressor to estimate suicide rates on a county basis, taking into account the prevalence of mental disorders, age demographics and gender distribution. We aim to assist public health agencies and policy makrs to tailor their efforts in order to curb the suicide rates.
